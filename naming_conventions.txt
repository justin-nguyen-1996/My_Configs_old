In general, avoid underscores because longer_named_words_can_look_weird.
Use camelCase because it makes things look like a singleUnit.

Try to only use underscores to group functions together
 - Test1_Cropped, Test2_Inverted
 - ADC_Init, ADC_Calibrate

Don't use anything special for boolean variables
 - like every other function param, the user should just go look at the documentation

Classes, constructors, module names, file names, objects created from custom classes (e.g. by invoking the constructor)
 - use CamelCase to distinguish their importance

Directory names
 - use Camel_Case (no good reason other than I happen to think it looks better on Github)
