Snippets:
 - install Vundle first (follow directions on Vundle git page)
   - if the bundle directory wasn't created properly, try just normally cloning the repo and moving/renaming it
   - if that doesn't work, then just copy the bundle directory from your old computer
 - open vim and run :PluginInstall
 - replace appropriate snip-files in .vim/bundle/vim-snippets/snippets with the ones from the repo 
   - c.snippets
   - cpp.snippets
   - java.snippets
   - python.snippets
 
Language-Specific Files:
 - copy the files in ftplugin/* from the repo into ~/.vim/after/ftplugin
 - copy the files in syntax/* from the repo into ~/.vim/after/syntax/
 - NOTE: make the directories if you have to (you probably will)

Template Files:
 - copy the files in templates/* from the repo into ~/.vim/bundle/vim-template/templates/

Miscellaneous Notes:
 - Might need to download vim and just copy the zip's vim folder into the correct place (if man pages and stuff not present)
 - Extra configuration might be needed to setup the vim undo tree (can't remember at the moment)
 - git config core.autocrlf false
