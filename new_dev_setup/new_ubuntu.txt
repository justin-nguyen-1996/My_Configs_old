Increase sudo time with
 - sudo visudo
 - Change the defaults line to become 
   - Defaults        env_reset,timestamp_timeout=120

Always be sudo with
 - sudo -s  -->  could put this in .profile (but this is somewhat dangerous) (i.e. you better know what you're doing)

Auto-maximized terminal
 - open a terminal --> go to the launcher --> right-click and choose "Lock to Launcher"
 - go to the edits bar (top of the screen) --> then profile preferences --> change initial terminal size to something really big
   
Config Files (see Github Repo):
 - be careful about what you copy over (trust me)
 - might need to run dos2unix on files that give weird errors
 - directly copy over .bashrc, .inputrc, .tmux.conf
 - copy .profile from repo --> next set variable $ENV_TYPE appropriately in .profile 
 - copy vimrc from repo
    - install Vundle (NOTE: DO NOT follow directions on Vundle git page)
      - just normally clone the repo and move it into the location specified on the Vundle git page
      - if that doesn't work, then just copy the bundle directory from your old computer
    - open vim and run :PluginInstall
 - delete Ubuntu's .bash_profile file
 
Symlinks:
 - Make a Github dir (mkdir ~/Github)
 - c.snippets    (ln -s ~/.vim/bundle/vim-snippets/snippets/c.snippets)
 - cpp.snippets  (ln -s ~/.vim/bundle/vim-snippets/snippets/cpp.snippets)
 - java.snippets (ln -s ~/.vim/bundle/vim-snippets/snippets/java.snippets)
 - python.snippets (ln -s ~/.vim/bundle/vim-snippets/snippets/python.snippets)

Snippets:
 - might need to run dos2unix on files that give weird errors
 - replace appropriate snip-files in .vim/bundle/vim-snippets/snippets with the ones from the repo 
   - c.snippets
   - cpp.snippets
   - java.snippets
   - python.snippets
 
~/.vim/after/ files
 - NOTE: make these directories if you have to (you probably will)
 - copy the files in ftplugin/* from the repo into ~/.vim/after/ftplugin
 - copy the files in syntax/* from the repo into ~/.vim/after/syntax/
 - copy the files in plugin/* from the repo into ~/.vim/after/plugin/

Template Files:
