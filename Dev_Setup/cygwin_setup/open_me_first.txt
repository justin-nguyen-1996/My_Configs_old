   - how to automate cygwin package installation
 - vim --> check that this is Vim 8.0 and has +clipboard support (run vim --version)
 - git
 - zip
 - unzip
 - ctags
 - tmux
 - make
 - dos2unix
 
 - there are probably more, these were all that I could think of at the top of my head

Terminal Settings
 - find the shortcut for cygwin --> right-click --> properties --> shortcut tab at the top 
                                --> shortcut key = Ctrl + Alt + C
					            --> run = maximized
 
Miscellaneous Notes:
 - might need to run dos2unix on files that give weird errors
 - remove unnecessary folders from ~/
