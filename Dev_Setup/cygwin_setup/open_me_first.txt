Install cygwin packages
 - for an automated installation:
   - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/745275/can-i-script-a-cygwin-install-to-include-certain-packages
   - how to automate cygwin package installation
 - vim --> check that this is Vim 8.0 and has +clipboard support (run vim --version)
 - git
 - zip
 - unzip
 - ctags
 - tmux
 - make
 - cmake
 - tree
 - dos2unix

 - there are probably more, these were all that I could think of at the top of my head

Terminal Settings
 - find the shortcut for cygwin --> right-click --> properties --> shortcut tab at the top
                                --> shortcut key = Ctrl + Alt + C
					            --> run = maximized

Torrent Microsoft Office (Word/Powerpoint/Excel)
 - https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/9525158/Microsoft_Office_Professional_Plus_[x64]_2013_Activator_Included
 - click get torrent
 - get a torrent program first (on the same page --> get bitlord)

X11 Forwarding
 - download X2Go from internet (not Cygwin)
 - for the desktop environment --> use GNOME instead of KDE --> just ignore the "printer/file sharing" error
 - shouldn't need to install the following into Cygwin, but I'll leave this here just in case
   - install xauth
   - install xorg-server
   - install xinit
   - run `startxwin &`

Miscellaneous Notes:
 - might need to run dos2unix on files that give weird errors
 - remove unnecessary folders from ~/
