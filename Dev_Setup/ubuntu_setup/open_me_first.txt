Increase sudo time with
 - sudo visudo
 - Change the defaults line to become 
   - Defaults        env_reset,timestamp_timeout=600

System Settings (can search it or click the gear on the left side of the launcher)
 - Brightness & Lock --> change the time it takes to lock the screen (off and never)
 - Appearance --> change the desktop background

Auto-maximized terminal
 - open a terminal --> go to the launcher --> right-click and choose "Lock to Launcher"
 - go to the edits bar (top of the screen) --> then profile preferences --> change initial terminal size to something really big
 
Miscellaneous notes:
 - might need to run dos2unix on files that give weird errors
 - remove unnecessary folders from ~/
 - there is a '.install_conda_libs.sh' script in this directory 
   - don't run it
   - it's only there to be called by 'config_ubuntu.sh'
 - if ipython can't find your modules --> compare results of 'which python' and 'which ipython'
                                      --> if already the same then add exe to the front of the path (i.e. find ipython executable in ~/miniconda2/bin/ipython)

Virtual Box
 - for guest additions
     power down vm --> settings --> add optical drive (leave empty)
     power on vm --> devices --> insert guest additions

 - for copy/paste between host and VM
     power down vm --> settings --> general --> advanced --> bidirectional for shared clipboard and drag/drop

 - for multiple monitors
	 power down vm --> settings --> screen --> monitor count = 2 --> video memory increased (e.g. 100 MB)

 - Vbox shared folder
	 devices --> shared folders --> intuitive setup
	 then go to here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox/SharedFolders
	 sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=$UID,gid=$(id -g) sharedFolderName pathOnLinuxVMToSharedFolder
	   --> example:  sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=$UID,gid=$(id -g) newSharedFolder ~/sharedFolder
